              <h3 class="display-6">My name is Maria. I'm studying Computer Science at KEA - 4th semester.</h3>
              <p class="lead">When I’m not studying, I primarily spend my time on my 7-year-old daughter.
                Since 2016 I have been spending my time once a week singing with other fantastic humans in a choir (Coret) – I love to sing, and it brings me so much joy.
                I also also love meeting up with my family or friends for a good chat over a cup of coffee or tea, and When I can find the time, I like to sit down either by the computer to code or to play World of Warcraft or enjoy a good book on the sofa - preferably a book on historical fiction.
